            "body": "Hi again \n\nThanks for sharing all the details, this is very clear. We can definitely build a custom proofing and approval system that covers everything you’ve outlined.\n\nThe way it would work is that you, as the admin, can create a project and upload multiple design items under it. A unique shareable link will be generated for the client, and they won’t need to log in. Clients will be able to view all the assets, drop pinpoint comments or annotations on each one, and either approve or request changes for every item.\n\nEach design item will support version control, so when you upload a new version it will be saved as V1, V2, and so on. Clients will be able to compare versions and see the full history. Once all the individual items are approved, the project can automatically be marked as fully approved, or you or the client can mark it done. Notifications will be sent to your team whenever a comment or approval is made.\n\nAt the end, or on request, the system will generate a downloadable approval report in PDF format. The report will list all items, versions, comments, timestamps, and client names.\n\nThis will run alongside your existing tools like WooCommerce and Basecamp, so you don’t need to change your current setup. It will work as an independent proofing tool, very similar to what you had with WeTransfer but fully customized to your needs and owned by you.\n\nIf this direction looks good, I can share a quick proposal with the timeline and phases for how we can roll it out.\n\nBest regards,\nRashid",

I agree with you on the approval report it’s not something you’ll be using every day, but since it’s not too complicated, I think it’s worth having. It gives you a proper record if you ever need it, and if you’d like we can keep it simple in the first release and expand it later.\n\nOn the timeline, no problem at all. We can have a fully functional system ready well before October 22nd. I’ll plan to deliver it at least a a week earlier so you have time to test everything, make sure there are no issues, and transition smoothly before WeTransfer shuts down.\n\nI’ll prepare a proposal with the phases, timeline, and pricing so you can review and we can move forward quickly.\n\nBest regards,\nRashid",

They involved features like uploading assets, versioning, comment/approval workflows, and admin controls, so I’m very familiar with the workflow you’re describing.\n\nFor example:\n\nI built a custom approval system for 360sitevisit.com, a company that provides virtual venue tours. Their clients can review the virtual tour projects, add comments, and either approve or request changes. This system has been live and working smoothly for the past six years.\n\n\nI’m also currently working with a credit repair services company. In this system, clients submit requests for credit repair, provide documents, and the agency reviews the information, performs the service, and then shares proof of the work back with the client. This one is still under development but follows a very similar workflow to what you need.\n\nSince many of these projects are private, I can’t share the live portals directly, but I can prepare a couple of UI references and example flows (similar to what we’ll build for you) so you get a clear picture of how smooth and user-friendly the experience will be.\n\nAs you mentioned wanting a very smooth and modern UI/UX, I’ll make sure the design stays clean, intuitive, and simple for your clients to use without training. Once you send me your Photoshop reference, I’ll align everything with your vision as well.\n\nBest regards,\nRashid",

Since those systems are private, I can’t share direct screenshots, but what I can do is prepare some sample wireframes and UI references for you. That way you’ll have a clear idea of the flow and design, and once you share your Photoshop reference, I can align everything with your vision.\n\nBest,\nRashid",

With \"+New Project\" button. and a \"Search\" field so we can search for projects. and or maybe \"Archive\" panel where we can send \"Archived\" projects after they have been approved. \n- Client Front end Dashboard (showing the grid of all their creative elements in their order)\n- Client Single Element proof page (showing the full element they selected along with the \"Approve\" or \"Revision/ Comment\" fields. Im thinking perhaps a simple thread of comments. with a \"Submit comment\" button and a \"Forward and Backward\" button along with small thumbnails of the other elements that they can also click on to load and provide comments or approval. \n",

The visuals you’re preparing will definitely help us align perfectly on the design and flow.\n\nYour breakdown makes a lot of sense:\n\nAdmin Panel with clean grid layout, menu navigation, logo placement, new project button, search, and an archive for approved projects.\n\nClient Dashboard showing all creative elements in their order.\n\nSingle Element Proof Page with full view, approve/revision options, threaded comments, submit button, navigation between elements, and thumbnails for quick access.\n\n\nThis is exactly the kind of clarity that ensures we build something smooth and user-friendly for both your team and your clients. Once you share the visuals, I’ll refine the prototype accordingly and keep things moving.\n\nBest regards,\nRashid",
